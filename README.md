# VectorFlex SVG Studio

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

SVG Studio is a web application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for working with Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). It allows users to create, animate, edit, optimize, convert, and generate SVG images utilizing artificial intelligence, offering a powerful suite of features for working with vector-based graphics.

## Stage
This Application isn'r fully functional yet and its development has been paused till further notice.
## Features

### SVG Animation Studio

The SVG Animation Studio enables users to create dynamic and interactive animations within SVGs. It provides a user-friendly interface for defining keyframes, transitions, and SMIL animations to bring SVG elements to life.

### Advanced SVG Morphing

The Advanced SVG Morphing feature allows users to smoothly transform one SVG shape into another. Utilizing path data interpolation and modern animation techniques, users can achieve seamless shape morphing effects.

### SVG Editing Studio

The SVG Editing Studio empowers users to edit and manipulate SVGs with ease. It provides a range of tools for modifying paths, adjusting colors, resizing elements, and applying filters to enhance the visual appearance of SVGs.

### SVG Conversion

SVG Conversion enables users to convert raster images (e.g., PNG, JPEG) into vector-based SVG format. This feature helps retain the visual details of images while harnessing the scalability and flexibility of SVGs.

### SVG Optimization

The SVG Optimization feature optimizes SVG files for improved performance and reduced file size. It removes unnecessary or redundant code, compresses the file, and simplifies complex shapes to ensure faster loading times.

### SVG AI Generator

The SVG AI Generator utilizes artificial intelligence to create raster images and converts them into SVG format on demand. This feature leverages advanced algorithms to generate high-quality vector-based graphics from raster images, expanding the possibilities of working with different image formats
